# Fundamentals-Of-Data-Analysis-52446-Tasks
Repository containing the Tasks assessment for Fundamentals of Data Analysis in 2020, it contains all tasks within a single Jupyter Notebook.

This Repository has been created by - Keith Ryan (G00387816@gmit.ie)

The general structure of the notebook is a series of Tasks that were assigned throughout the semester. The tasks themselves are broken up into sections using Jupyter's Markdown cells and under each task is a description which is generally followed by a section on researching the task and attempting some solutions, after this subsection follows a section formalising the earlier work (usually into a function), in a few cases where I found some aspect of the task interesting I break off to explore that a bit and this is called out in the markdown to denote that it is not strictly the assigned task.

## Task 1 - counts function

## Task 2 - dicerolls function

## Task 3 - coinflip heads distribution

## Task 4 - Simpson's Paradox
