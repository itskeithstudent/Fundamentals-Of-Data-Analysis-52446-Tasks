    "A binomial distribution in simple terms is a distribution that shows the amount of times some event occurs when there are two possible outcomes and given it has a fixed probability of occurring and all occurrences are independent (an example of this for coin flip being yes/no for heads over 100 coin flips).\n",
    "\n",
    "I've skipped ahead a bit and produced a binomial distribution which can be seen in the below image, here the y axis shows the probability for each of the bins, the bins are along the x-axis and this represents the number of heads from coin flips (the bin size in this case is in steps of 5 starting from 20 ending at 80), and in this case the probability of getting between 50 and 55 is around 0.35.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the case of this example whether we are counting the occurrences of heads or tails with the distribution is subjective (as either event is just as likely), in fact with the binomial function we are not explicitly asking it to tell us the number of occurences of heads, instead what we are asking of the function is to show us the number of occurrences for an event with a 50% chance of happening, happens over 100 tries and then repeating that 1000 times.\n",
